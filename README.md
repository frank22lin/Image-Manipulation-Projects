### Image-Manipulation-Projects

This repository contains 4 individual Projects relating to Image Manipulation, i.e. linear and non-linear [Image Filters](Image_Filters) using convolution, 
recognizing [Handwritten Digits](Image_Recognition) from the MNIST Dataset using Principal Component Analysis, [Spline Interpolation](Polynomial_Interpolation)
using Hermite and Natural Splines and [seamlessly cloning](Seamless_Cloning) an image into another image using Gradient approximation and linear sets of 
equations.
